Improvements I would like to make:

Enhancing the digital coding extraction pipeline by incorporating additional cases to handle a wider range of documents.
Utilizing LLM to process the extracted data and refine it to retain only the necessary information.
Addressing the primary challenge of text extraction from scanned PDFs by leveraging OpenCV and LLM simultaneously for improved accuracy
